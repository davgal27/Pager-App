**Pager** is a book tracking companion app made with flutter that lets users manage their reading list, track progress, and organize books easily. It has features like the ability to reread and re-rate books, an advanced filter management for the data curious, and the ability to add custom notes at different parts of your readin journey with a book.

Currently the app is based on local JSON storage, however the app provides a perfect canvas to be expanded on for integration with an API such as google books to access real and global book markets and data (an example in mind is google books)

It was made as a project for User interface programming with an emphasis on data manipulation, at the Brno university of Technology.
