**Pager** is a book tracking companion app made with flutter that lets users manage their reading list, track progress, and organize books easily. It has features like the ability to reread and re-rate books, an advanced filter management for the data curious, and the ability to add custom notes at different parts of your readin journey with a book. Currently the app is based on local storage, however the app provides a perfect canvas to be expanded on for integration with an API such as google books to access real and global book markets.

It was made as a project for User interface programming with an emphasis on data manipulation, at the Brno university of technology
